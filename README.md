# ðŸ¦© Weather widget project ðŸ¦©

## ðŸŒ¼ My second React's project, where I am using useState() and useEffect() to fetch the api. Also have some fun with units converter (still don't know why we ALL aren't using Celsius). The weather will be shown to us depending of the lon/lat we actually have/are.
