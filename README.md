# 🦩 Weather widget project 🦩

 🌼 My second React's project, focusing on weather API, useState(), useEffect() and whole banch of other things. Also have some fun with units converter (still don't know why we ALL aren't using Celsius). The weather will be shown depending of the lon/lat we actually have/are.
